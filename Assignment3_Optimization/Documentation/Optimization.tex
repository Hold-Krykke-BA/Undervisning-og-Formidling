\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Remember box plots \& hardware details (requested by Martin). 
    \item[--] Run both programs and collect timings for later calculations (Task 1, bullet point 2)
    \item[--] Use the profiler as hinted in the assignment  
    \item[--] This could probably be done even faster in Python
    \item[--] Follow the links on \href{https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2021spring/UFO/week-14/#3-performance-and-optimization}{the course page}. There are some hints on microbenchmarking.

\section{Introduction}

We decided to use the supplied program, \emph{letterfrequencies}, for the optimization task.

The program source consists of the foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov (roughly 25.000 lines of text) and a single Java file.
The file reads the text and returns the frequencies of the letters within the text.

\section{Initial program}
The program is purposefully written in an inefficient way. It has two helper methods and at its core it presents a list of the letter frequencies between a-zA-Z. 

Below you can find a sample of the output of the program:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc}
    Letter & Frequencies \\
    E      & 118313      \\
    T      & 87190       \\
    A      & 76011       \\
    O      & 74907       \\
    N      & 67908       \\
    ...    & ...         \\
    K      & 6630        \\
    X      & 1457        \\
    Q      & 1017        \\
    J      & 806         \\
    Z      & 674        
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The 5 most and least frequent letters in the dataset}

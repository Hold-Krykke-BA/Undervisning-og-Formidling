Work either on the following project (https://github.com/CPHBusinessSoftUFO/
letterfrequencies), or on a an earlier project of yours (something you can
optimize).

\subsection{Task 1}
\label{sec:1.1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find a point in your program that can be optimized (for speed), for example by using a profiler.
    \item Make a measurement of the point to optimize, for example by running a
    number of times, and calculating the mean and standard deviation (see
    the paper from Sestoft).
    \item If you work on the letterfrequencies program, make it at least 50\%
    faster.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sec:1.2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Short introduction of the program and the part to be optimized
    \item Documentation of the current performance
    \item Explanation of bottleneck(s)
    \item A hypothesis of what causes the problem
    \item A changed program with better performance
    \item Documentation of the new performance
    \item Written in \LaTeX\ 
\end{itemize}
